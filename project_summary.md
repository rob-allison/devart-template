## Description
By using a kind of 'binary dna' to create individual colours I have been able to escape from the familiar RGB/HSV colour model and treat colour as the expression of a process. Previous experimentation can be found here:

The themes I want to explore are:
* growth - how a simple genetic sequence is translated into a complex structure.
* breeding - how two sequences combine to produce a third that expresses characteristics from its parents.
* selection - how a population as a whole evolves under a selection pressure

Underpinning all this is an effort to show how something almost natural can emerge from the purely computational when iterated to sufficient scale.

I propose to determine a method of constructing something resembling a flower, using 'binary dna' as input. There would be a population of such flowers. Visitors would be able to select flowers to breed together, the resulting offspring then added to the population. Flowers would have a lifespan, and would be removed after a certain time. This changing population would be displayed with a suitable taxonomy.

Hence the exhibit would evolve according to the preferences of visitors, with potential for effects - for example speciation - that can be found in the natural world.
