## bDNA

In nature, DNA is comprised of a sequence of nucleotides, each of Adenine(A), Guanine(G), Thymine(T) or Cytosine(C). These are the base 'letters' of nature's code - eg '...GATTACA...'. Each group of three bases, or 'Codon', codes for a specific amino acid. The acids assemble to form the proteins from which we are made. 

In the language of binary computation, there are two letters, or 'bits': '1' (on) and '0' (off). Binary DNA (bDNA) would look something like: '...101000111...'.

Following nature's example, a group of four bits (a 'nibble') will be considered a binary codon - and will encode for one of 16 possible combinations, represented by hexadecimal 0-F. Decoding and assembling a sequence of 128 bits would result in a digital 'protein' of 32 hex digits. By summing the values of each digit, and dividing by two, a value between 0 and 240 can be derived from each digital protein. These values are (more or less) normally distributed - ie 120 occurs much more frequently than 0. This is handy as many natural properties, for example height, follow a normal distribution.

## Colours

To derive a colour, a sequence of bDNA of 512 bits is translated into 4 digital proteins, each controlling a single channel Red, Green, Blue or Alpha (ignored for now). The 'value' of each protein determines the channel value, and hence together the resulting colour.
