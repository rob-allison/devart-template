## Flower Growth Structure

If the digital flower is conceived as a grid of oversized pixels ('blocks'), then taking inspiration from nature,
growth would happen by adding new blocks to the centre, whilst pushing rings of existing blocks outwards. Blocks can be analogous
to petals in a flower head. However the size of the blocks is fixed, unlike petals, so blocks in each ring will
need to divide (at random) as the ring expands:

1. 4 initial blocks  2. Blocks move outward and divide to form the next ring  3. The process is repeated, with new blocks appearing in the centre.

### Growth coloured by alternating generations of blocks/petals

### Growth coloured by age of blocks/petals

The diagonal flares are actually an optical illusion.

### Growth coloured by the initial position of the block when first appearing

Concentric rings produced by this process are evocative of real petals.

### Combining all three colourations

A much greater block density has been used. By using this growth process, a flower like construct can appear. 
This logical structure can be used to control the expression of DNA as the digital flower grows,
to create the desired effects.
