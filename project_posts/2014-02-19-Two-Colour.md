## Two-Colour

A flower of a single colour would be too simple - it would be just a block, as I've always
used colour variation instead of lines and shapes to structure my images.

2 colours is the next step. Still simple enough to be readily understandable, but the interplay can bring structure
within an individual and across a population.

Rotational symmetry and variation from centre to periphery are two characteristics of flowers that can translate to
digital productions and will anchor viewers' understanding.
