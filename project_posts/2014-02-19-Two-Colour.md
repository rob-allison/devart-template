## Two-Colour

A flower of a single colour would be too simple - it would be just a block, as I've always
used colour variation instead of lines and shapes to structure my images.

2 colours is the next step. Still simple enough to be readily understandable, but the interplay can bring structure
within an individual and across a population.

Rotational symmetry and variation from centre to periphery are two characteristics of flowers that can translate to
digital productions and will anchor viewers' understanding. Something like this can be achieved with two coloured squares:

It is possible to imagine each colour to be controlled by a section of dna, a chromasome. Breeding two such flowers may occur with simple swapping of entire chromosomes like so (mirrors and other combinations also shown):
