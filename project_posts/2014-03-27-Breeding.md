## Breeding

Two flowers can be bred together by mixing their bDNA. Four kinds of mixing are are used:

* Interchanging entire 'chromosomes' - flowers have 3 chromosomes, controlling inner colour, outer colour, and transition.
* Interchanging fragments within chromosomes.
* Swapping chomosomes (eg inner to outer colour)
* Mutating a chromosome.

All randomly controlled. An example:

## Population

Repeated breeding builds up a population - the characteristics of which may shift as breeding progresses. Here 5 flowers are generated at random to seed a population, then flowers are added by repeatedly breeding 2 of the most recent 10: (two examples, side by side)
